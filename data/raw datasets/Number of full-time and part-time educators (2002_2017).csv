Footnotes:
1,"All counts are randomly rounded to a multiple of 3 using the following procedure: counts that are already a multiple of 3 are not adjusted; counts 1 greater than a multiple of 3 are adjusted to the next lowest multiple of 3 with a probability of two-thirds and to the next highest multiple of 3 with a probability of one-third. The probabilities are reversed for counts that are 1 less than a multiple of 3."
2,"The data are subject to revision."
3,"Includes all employees who belong to one of the three following categories: teachers, school administrators, and pedagogical support personnel."
4,"Care should be taken with cross-jurisdictional comparisons. The proportion of educators (comprising a mix of teachers, administrators and pedagogical support) differs in each jurisdiction."
5,"Figures may not add up to the sum of all categories due to missing categories and/or rounding values."
6,"Educational assistants are excluded."
7,"Ontario began including early childhood educators in 2010/2011; therefore, data for 2010/2011 and subsequent years are not strictly comparable with data for the years before 2010/2011."
8,"In Manitoba, data prior to 2011/2012 are not comparable with more recent data due to a change in methodology."
9,"All educators in Lloydminster are included in Saskatchewan's counts and not in the counts for Alberta."
10,"In Alberta, data prior to 2004/2005 are not comparable with more recent data due to a change in methodology."
11,"In British Columbia, data prior to 2012/2013 are not comparable with more recent data due to a change in data source and reporting approach."
12,"In Yukon, data prior to 2012/2013 are not comparable with more recent data due to a change in methodology."
